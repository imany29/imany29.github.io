            I wanted to create an alarm system that allows families to know their child is entering a room they're not supposed to i.e., the buzzer, while also implementing a signifier to the 
            <p>
            child i.e., the LED strip.

            <h2>Materials!</h2>
            <p>
            <h4>Primary Components</h4>
            <ul>
                <li> arduino uno </li>
                <li> transistor </li>
                <li> ultrasonic sensor </li>
                <li> led strip </li>
                <li> buzzer </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <h4>Secondary Components</h4>
            <ul>
                <li> wires </li>
                <li> 10k resistor </li>
                <li> usb cord </li>
                <li> power source </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Prototype Setup!</h2>
            <p>
            <img src="alarmsystem2.jpg" width=400></a>
            <p>
            Through the setup, I taped the LED strip to the door frame, and placed the ultrasonic sensor towards the lower half of the door frame. 
            <p>This allowed the user to not have the sensor in their direct view, while also allowing the sensor to serve it's purpose.

            <h2>Code Snippet!</h2>
            <p>
            My code was fairly straightforward, but I ran into a few problems with the ultrasonic sensor in my code. Determing the distance between the door and sensor, and implementing 
            <p>
            a 2 microsecond delay were the 2 things I struggled with most. I initally did not implement a delay at all which resulted in inconsistent results.
