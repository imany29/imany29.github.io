            By placing my finger on the photoresistor, the LED strip will go from dim to bright!

               Through the calculation below, it shows how much current will flow through the transistor. As I only use 63 LEDs from the LED strip, it uses a smaller amount of watts compared to the 18 watts that typically go through 300 LEDs. 

               I chose to use 10k resistor for safety purposes. As I was using power from both the outlet, and 5v on the arduino, 10k was the safest option to ensure my lights did not burn out. 
            <p>
                (300 LEDs) / (18 watts) = (63 LEDs) / (i watts)
                </p>
                i = 3.78 watts
                </p>
                </p>
                V = 5 - 1.8(V drop) = 3.2v
                3.2 = 0.02 x R(ohms)
                R = 3.2/0.02 = 160(ohms)
